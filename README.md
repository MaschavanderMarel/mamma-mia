# Setup

- Use Chrome browser
- Open index.html
- Set browser to most narrow display mode for best emulation experience. Alternatively, it is also possible to use developer tools, toggle device toolbar and select for example iphone 6,7,8. However, the embedded video controls are not emulated very well and become too small to be displayed properly, which is not the case on a physical phone.

# Usage

- All screens are navigable and clickable. If a functionality has not been implemented yet, you are redirected to an underConstruction page.
- When playing a dance video, you can at any moment hit the breakdown button. This leads you to the fragment which is closest to where you were in the video when the button was hit. The fragment is played back in slow motion with muted sound. When you return to the full video, you return to the same playing position where you left off.
