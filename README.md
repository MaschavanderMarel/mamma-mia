# Setup

- Use Chrome browser
- Open index.html
- Set browser to most narrow display mode for best emulation experience. (This works better than using developer tools, toggle device toolbar and select for example iphone 6,7,8, because the embedded video controls are not emulated very well. They become too small to be displayed properly, which is not the case on a physical phone.)

# Usage

- All screens are navigable and clickable. If a page has not been implemented yet, you are redirected to an underConstruction page.
- When you have selected a song to dance to, you are asked whether you want to record yourself with a popup.
- When playing a dance video, you can hit the breakdown button at any moment. This pauses the recording and leads you to the fragment which is closest to where you were in the video when the button was hit. The fragment is played back in slow motion with muted sound. 
- When you return to the full video, you return to the same playing position where you left off. For privacy reasons, you are asked again whether you want to record yourself. 
- When you finish playing the dance video, you are asked to share a video of yourself.
